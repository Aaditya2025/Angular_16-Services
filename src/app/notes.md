🎯 What to Think of When You Hear "Dependency Injection"
💡 Definition (Simple Words)
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern where you don’t create dependencies (like services) yourself — Angular gives them to you automatically.

A "dependency" is just something your class (like a component or another service) needs to work, like UserService, HttpClient, etc.

"Injection" means Angular supplies those dependencies to your class instead of you creating them manually.

🧠 Real-Life Analogy: The Coffee Machine ☕
Imagine you are a Barista (like a Component). You need:
Coffee Beans
Water
Electricity

You could go out and:
Grow your own coffee beans 🌱
Build a water pump 💧
Wire electricity ⚡

But that’s too much.

So instead, your Coffee Shop (Angular) injects all those things into your workspace — you just focus on making coffee (the actual logic/UI).

✅ In Angular:
constructor(private coffeeService: CoffeeService) {}
Angular: “Oh, you need CoffeeService? Got it. Here's the instance.” 💉
